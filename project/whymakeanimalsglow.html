            <p>In order to test the functionality of an immunocompetent gene without physically inflicting the disease on animals, scientists interlaced the immunocompetent gene to a bioluminescent gene that gives off a visible sign of functionality. This not only helps the scientists with finding the functioning genes out of all trials, but the bioluminescence also helps save the lives of the animals who were the trial subjects. </p>

            <p>By adding more ethical thinking to the testing on live animals, these researchers not only save the lives of innocent animals but also help to further the research in the future. The safer the trials are, the more likely the scientists are to receive funding for more test trials.</p>

            <p>This ethical concept for testing is important because these animals are being tested with diseases that are not usually transmitted to humans. By keeping the animals safe and increasing the number of tests able to take place, scientists have created a revolutionary way of testing which can one day become a way to cure many diseases.</p>
