    <h2>About the Author</h2>

    <p>Growing up, Alexandra was always fascinated by marine biology and all things related to the deep sea. Her freshman year of high school, she was given the opportunity to publish an article relating to any topic of choice. With her interest in marine biology, she decided to pursue a topic surrounding the deep sea but also how it can relate to human biology. </p>
    
    <p>Through this, she was inspired to learn more about how the genetic transfers of certain aquatic species genes can be used in medicine to help cure diseases. This research was very informative in both a biological and medical sense on the different techniques that scientists use to create remedies for illnesses and diseases. All of the following information explaining the process of bioluminescent gene transfers was inspired by the article she wrote in 2019 for her Honors Biology project. </p>

    <h2>Introduction to Gene Transfers</h2>

    <p>Recent research has been found that some deep-sea creatures may contain genetic traits that immunize them to certain diseases that can be transmitted to humans when coming from other animals. Scientists have created bioluminescent, or glowing, animals in order to find a functioning gene to immunize animals against specific diseases that humans are also susceptible to. </p>
    
    <p>By combining the immunocompetent gene (uncompromised) with a bioluminescent (glowing) gene, scientists are able to test the function with visible results. Without the combination of the two, the only way to test the functionality would be by injecting the specific pathogen into the animal which could lead to the death of an animal whose immunocompetence was impotent. </p>
    
    <p>Using the process of injecting the gene duo into trial embryos, scientists have been able to test different types of immunocompetent genes on multiple animal species. These tests, revolutionary to all medical testing, are curing many diseases of humans and other animals.</p>
