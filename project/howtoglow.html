    <h2>Why use bioluminescent genes?</h2>

    <p>By intertwining the immunocompetent genes with bioluminescent genes, scientists were able to use the visible results of the bioluminescent gene to find that the animals that glowed under a blacklight were also immune due to a dependent relationship between the two genes. Essentially, if the gene transfer was successful and the animal was able to glow under the blacklight, it was assumed that the animal was also immune to the specific disease it was associated with. </p>

    <p>The interlaced genes are combined to a point where if one shows functionality, the other will function too (a dependent relationship between the two). Had the connection between the genes been weak, the scientists could possibly end up with bioluminescent animals that are not immunocompetent or vice versa. This is a problem because immunodeficiency is the goal but it can only be ethically tested if the bioluminescent gene is directly related to the immunocompetent gene. If the connection is weak and there is no way to tell which gene functioned properly, there is no point in connecting them in the first place.</p>

    <section> 
    <h2>How are the genes transferred from one animal to another?</h2>
    <p>During the process of the gene transfers, the gene duo was injected into the embryos of the trial animals' mothers. This process inserts the gene duo into the unborn eggs of the test subjects (mother animals) allowing for the gene to become part of their chemical makeup. </p>

    <p>Depending on whether the gene was rejected or encompassed by the embryo, the trial subject will either become immunocompetent and bioluminescent, or neither. They inject the gene duo because the results are most promising when the gene has a longer period of time to connect the chemical makeup of the embryo rather than a one-day old animal whose chemical makeup is finished for the most part.</p>
