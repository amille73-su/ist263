        My name is Alexandra Miller-Thomas. I am an Applied Data Analytics major with a minor in Marketing and am interested in finding and examining patterns related to human and/or animal data. I am in the Syracuse Renee Crown Honors program and have been on the Honor Roll throughout my time at Syracuse University. As well as my accomplishments, throughout my time at SU I have gained many technical skills such as SQL, Python, and Excel. Outside of work/school, I am on the Syracuse University Synchronized Figure Skating team and used to be a Varsity Hockey player (both Ice Hockey and Field Hockey) in Highschool.
